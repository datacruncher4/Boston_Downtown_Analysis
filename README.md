# Boston Downtown Analysis

### Exploring Downtown Eateries

The city of Boston was founded in 1630. The largest of the city's commercial districts, Downtown is the location of many corporate or regional headquarters; city, county, state and federal government facilities; and many of Boston's tourist attractions. Similar to other central business districts in the U.S., Downtown has recently undergone a transformation that included the construction of new condos and lofts, renovation of historic buildings, and arrival of new residents and businesses.

Bostonâ€™s downtown is extremely busy during the day as hundreds of thousands of office workers and tourists descend on the area. Though many of Boston's swankiest restaurants are located Downtown, budget restaurants tend to be geared towards the horde of office workers.

In this project, I explored all the food serving joints in Boston's Financial District which is a major part of Boston Downtown. I started the analysis with exploring the venues based on ratings, tips and likes. This was followed by geo-analysis of the restaurants using Folium maps. All the restaurants were plotted on a map to get a general sense of their locations. After this, I plotted the top restaurants and most favorite restaurants as well. Next type of analysis that I performed was Clustering. I clustered the restaurants based on their location and ratings to get a list of similar restaurants.
